# experience

> this program does not explain.  
> it **runs**.

---

## before you start

**highly recommended:**

- minimize all other windows, notifications, and background distractions  
- use headphones  
- give the program uninterrupted time  

this is not about immersion.  
this is about **removing interference**.

---

## display settings (important)

all visual assets are authored in **1920×1080**.

for correct presentation, set your player / system / window mode to:

**„rozciągnij aby wypełnić ekran”**  
(*stretch to fill screen*)

black bars, letterboxing, or windowed scaling  
will distort timing and spatial intention.

this is not a cosmetic preference.  
it affects perception.

## transparency note

if you want full experience
- **go to**  
  https://perek2000.com

if you are uncomfortable running unfamiliar software:

- **read the source code first:**  
  https://github.com/Kacperrozdolski/Keygenperek2000
  (recommended if you need to understand *how* it works before letting it run)

if you are not technical or prefer not to execute anything locally:

- **watch a full playback recording:**  
  https://youtu.be/4xLQtd0RmEM
  (a complete run, recorded as-is, without interaction)

nothing here is hidden on purpose.  
only interpretation is.

---

## what it is

**experience** is a playback environment for a narrative that no longer fits  
linear time or clean categories.

it combines electronic sound, ritual rhythm, and textual fragments  
to document the moment *after* an epoch ends.

not the explosion.  
the **aftermath**.

---

## what it plays

- sound that behaves like memory  
- text that behaves like residue  
- silence treated as a valid state  

the program does not tell a story.  
it **exposes a process**:

- collapse of an old order  
- loss of external meaning  
- emergence of responsibility  
- reconstruction without guarantees  

this is not world-building.  
this is **after** the world.

---

## how it works

the engine progresses in layers:

1. **signal**  
   raw electronic structures, unstable, repetitive  
2. **interference**  
   ritual elements, pulses, cycles, breath  
3. **voice**  
   fragments of an internal log  
4. **decay**  
   intentional gaps, distortion, silence  

there is no restart.  
there is no save state.  
every run is final.

---

## interaction model

the listener is not a user.  
the listener is a **surface**.

inputs are minimal:
- start  
- continue  
- stop (not recommended)

no skipping.  
no fast-forward.  
time must be endured at playback speed.

---

## failure states

this program may cause:

- discomfort  
- misalignment  
- intrusive reflection  
- loss of narrative certainty  

these are not bugs.  
they indicate correct execution.

---

## output

there is no exported result.

if something changes in you,  
that is outside the scope of this software.

---

## requirements

- headphones  
- full-screen display (stretched to fill)  
- uninterrupted time  
- tolerance for ambiguity  

faith is not required.  
attention is.

---

## disclaimer

**experience** does not provide meaning.  
it creates a condition in which meaning  
must be assembled manually.

if you are looking for resolution,  
this program will disappoint you.

if you are looking for a beginning,  
do not trust the first minute.

---

## exit

there is no proper ending.

when playback stops,  
the program releases control.

what happens next  
is not documented.
